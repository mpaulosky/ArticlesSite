We have adopted a code of conduct from the Contributor Covenant. Contributors to this project are expected to adhere to
this code. Please report unwanted behavior to [Matthew Paulosky](mailto:matthew.paulosky@outlook.com)

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a branch from `develop` (use a descriptive name, e.g. `feature/123-add-search`).
3. Make your changes, following the code style and guidelines below.
4. Add or update tests as needed.
5. Commit with clear messages (see below).
6. Push your branch and open a Pull Request to `develop`.

## What should I know before I get started

This project is a practice project to build a Blazor Server application with .NET Aspire and MongoDB.

### Code Style & Commit Messages

- Use consistent formatting (C# conventions, .editorconfig if present).
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
  - Use present tense (e.g., "Add search feature")
  - Reference issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`)
- Add comments to explain complex logic.

### Project Folder Structure

This project is designed to be built and run primarily with Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider. The folders are
configured so that they will support editing and working in other editors and on non-Windows operating systems. We
encourage you to develop with these other environments, because we would like to be able to support developers who use
those tools as well. The folders are configured as follows:

```bash

and [releases tab in GitHub](https://github.com/mpaulosky/ArticleSite/releases).

## Design Decisions

### Design Decisions

Design for this project is ultimately decided by the project team
lead, [Matthew Paulosky](mailto:matthew.paulosky@outlook.com). The following project tenets are adhered to when making
decisions:

1. Use Blazor Server for the UI.
1. Use MongoDB for data persistence.
1. Provide both EF Core and native MongoDB driver options for data access.
1. Use .NET Aspire for cloud-native orchestration.
1. Follow clean architecture principles with repository pattern.

If you have suggestions, please open an issue or discuss in your pull request.

### How can I contribute

We are always looking for help on this project. There are several ways that you can help:
This means one of several types of contributions:

1. [Create an Issue](#create-an-issue)
1. [Respond to an Issue](#respond-to-an-issue)
1. [Write code](#write-code)
1. [Write documentation](#write-documentation)

## Contribution Types

- **Report a Bug:** Please add the `Bug` label so we can triage and track it.
- **Suggest an Enhancement:** Add the `Enhancement` label for new features or improvements.
- **Write Code:** All code should be linked to an issue. Include or update tests for new features and bug fixes.
- **Write Documentation:** Help us improve `/docs` and keep the main [README.md](../README.md) up to date.

### Create an Issue

Create a [New Issue Here](https://github.com/mpaulosky/ArticleSite/issues).

1. If you are reporting a `Bug` that you have found. Be sure to add the `Bug` label so that we can triage and track it.
1. If you are reporting an `Enhancement` that you think would improve the project. Be sure to add the `Enhancement`
   label so we can track it.

Please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and screenshots if helpful.

### Respond to an Issue

[Fork the Repository to your GitHub account](https://github.com/mpaulosky/ArticleSite/fork).

1. Create a new Branch from the develop branch with a reference to the existing Issue number.
1. Work on the issue.
1. Create Unit, Integration tests for any code that require them. We use [xUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/xunit/)
   to test our code and [bUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/bunit/) to test our blazor components.
1. When you are done Create a Pull Request from your branch to the develop branch.
1. Submit the Pull Request.

**Note:** Pull requests without unit tests will be delayed until tests are added. All new features and bug fixes must
include appropriate tests.

Any code that is written to support a blazor component or new functionality are required to be accompanied with unit
tests at the time the pull request is submitted. Pull requests without unit tests will be delayed and asked for unit
tests to prove their functionality.

### Review Process

1. All PRs are reviewed by maintainers and may require changes before merging.
2. Automated checks (build, tests, lint) must pass before review.
3. Be responsive to feedback and update your PR as needed.
4. Once approved, your PR will be merged into `develop`.

### Write code

All code should have an assigned issue that matches it. This way we can prevent contributors from working on the same
feature at the same time.

Code for components' features should also include some definition in the `/docs` folder so that our users can
identify and understand which feature is supported.

See [docs/](../docs) for feature documentation guidelines.

### Write documentation

The documentation for the project is always needed. We are always looking for help to add content to the `/docs`
section of the repository with proper links back through to the main `/README.md`.
